/**
@page NITESamplesOverview Samples Overview
To better understand how to use this extension, samples are provided. The samples are small, and include very 
basic usage of the package. Each sample is a tutorial that explains how to achieve
this simple behavior. A finished version of the tutorial is supplied as a Unity Scene for reference 
purposes.<br><br>
The samples are designed in a specific order,which means that you should finish the first sample tutorial
before moving onto the second one. This is to prevent the later samples being overloaded with repeated 
explanations of the same thing. <br>
It is assumed that you have already familiarized yourself with the base OpenNI package and have finished 
the samples and tutorials provided there

<H1>NITE-based Samples</H1>
Following is a list of tutorials that show samples that can be used for teaching the use of the
@ref NITEExtension.

@note It is assumed that before starting working on the tutorials, all relevant installations have
been completed (including the OpenNI Unity Toolkit). Furthermore, each tutorial assumes a new scene was created
for it. As such, it is assumed all OpenNI tutorials have been done (see the OpenNI Samples List in the OpenNIUnity Toolkit) as
the NITE tutorials repeat the previous samples using NITE controls rather than skeleton hand tracking.

<H2>Control Sphere with NITE Controls</H2>
This sample moves a sphere using NITE controls.
For more information and a tutorial, see @subpage NITESphereControlsTutorial

<H2>Control Cursor with Input (hand based)</H2>
This sample repeats the skeleton-based sample but replaces the control with NITE controls.
For more information and a tutorial, see @subpage NICursorInputTutorial

<H2>%NIGUI (hand based)</H2>
This sample repeats the skeleton-based sample but replaces the control with NITE controls.
For more information and a tutorial, see @subpage NITENIGUITutorial

@brief Included with this product are several samples aimed at helping the developer learn how 
to use the provided tools.<br>

For an overview on how to use the samples, see @ref NITESamplesList and for a list of the samples, see 
@ref NITESamplesList<br><br>

The samples have more than just scripts. They also use various general assets, prefabs and scenes
<H1>Prefabs</H1>
A single prefab is used, the HandsManagerPrefab.

 
<H1>Scenes</H1>
For each of the various samples, a scene is supplied with the finished result.
 
<H1>General Assets</H1>
For the samples to look good, various models, textures and materials are needed. They are located here.
