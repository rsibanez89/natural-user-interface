Colonial Viper by Richard Dyke

In order for some of the textures to work correctly 
you will need to use the Dirt plugin avialable free for download at 

http://www.3dluvr.com/content/maxedout.php

This is a 3D Max5 model, and all textures are included.

This took 4 days to build, if you make any pictures with it feel free to share them with me.
